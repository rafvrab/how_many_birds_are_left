# Exploring the Mathematics Behind a Joke: How Many Birds Are Left?

## Description

This Python project delves into the mathematical analysis of a classic joke involving birds on a rooftop. The joke humorously claims that no birds are left after shooting one, as they all fly away upon hearing the shot. The project explores the mathematical formulation of this scenario as a function and visualizes it using Python's Matplotlib library.

## Conclusion

Through this simple exercise, we demonstrate how the function \( f(p) \) remains immutable, consistently equal to 1, irrespective of the initial quantity of birds (\( p \)). The humor of the joke mirrors the mathematical constancy embedded in the scenario.
