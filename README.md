# Exploring the Mathematics Behind a Joke: How Many Birds Are Left?

## Description

This Python project delves into the mathematical analysis of a classic joke involving birds on a rooftop. The joke humorously claims that no birds are left after shooting one, as they all fly away upon hearing the shot. The project explores the mathematical formulation of this scenario as a function and visualizes it using Python's Matplotlib library.

## Features

- Mathematical analysis of the joke's scenario.
- Visualization of the function using Python Matplotlib.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python installed
- Matplotlib library installed (you can install it using `pip install matplotlib`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafvrab/how_many_birds_are_left.git
